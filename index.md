### CPSC120

* Lab 4

    Both parts of Lab 4 were a favorite because that was the first time we had to deal with multiple files, which showcased functions and if statements. I liked the challenge of working on it alone because I was more focused on where or what parameters I should use when calling a function in the main.cpp. For example, in part 1, we calculated the units from millimeters to teaspoons... into ounces using functions and calling them into the main file. On the other hand, in part 2, we guessed a user's secret number utilizing multiple if statements.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2, was a favorite because we worked on a program about Blackjack. My partner and I displayed our knowledge of if statements and conditional operators. As an illustration, we wrote a functions that calculates a card with or without an "Ace". Moving on, I learned to validate the arguments displayed in the command line and convert strings into integers. For example, when we input a number card, we convert it using "std::stoi," considering how the number card is still a string in the command line's perspective.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2, was also a favorite of mine since we had to deal with more variables and restrictions. First, we got a piece of paper and wrote each condition for each street. The diagram helped me concoct a clean if statement exhibiting whether one can park on the street. Specifically, the function "CanParkOnAsh" validates that we cannot park on Wednesday from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.
